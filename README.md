# Welcome to the React Accelerator!
The goal of the React Accelerator is to put together a set of materials that can take an engineer familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (ES6+) and train them on how to build advanced React applications. 

This should be accomplished using as many existing resources available to us as possible which can be supplemented with project work that can be completed and reviewed at a pace set by the person working through the material.
