# Welcome to the React Accelerator!

## What is it?
The goal of the React Accelerator is to put together a set of materials that can take an engineer familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (ES6+) and train them on how to build advanced React applications. 

This will be accomplished using as many existing resources available to us as possible, which will then be supplemented with project work that can be completed and reviewed at a pace set by the person working through the material.

## How does it work?
Everything will be done via online course content found within [this Udemy course](https://redventures.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) alongside projects, supplemental reading material, and guided tutorials.

If you have no previous experience with React, it's recommended that you start with React 101, but you can get a better idea of where to start by digging into the folders for each section and checking the requirements in the readme file.

Once you've completed the corresponding project for a section, push it up to Github and send your repository to Kelly Snyder via [Slack](slack://user?team=T029AV3QX&id=UB6FU5H42) or [email](mailto:kesnyder@redventures.com) for review. After that, you will receive a video explanation of a working solution for the project that you can use to review your own code.
