## Project
For your first project, you'll be converting a static **Note Taking App** into a single page React application!

The starter kit for this project are inside the `react-101/project-files` folder. This folder contains the HTML and CSS files that you'll use as a basis for your application.

Upon running the HTML file, you'll notice the functionality that the application _should_ offer: the ability to create a new note, to edit existing notes, as well as delete notes completely.

The sidebar should display all existing notes, along with their title and date and time of the last update, and the main body of the application should display whichever note is selected via the sidebar.

Now, knowing what the application needs to do, recreate it in React! A majority, if not all, of the concepts listed above will be utilized in your application.
